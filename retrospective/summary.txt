How merge conflict was resolved in part E1.)
	- In order to fix the merging conflicts between the two branches of Working and Test, I switched to the Working (master) 
          branch and used git add to let get know of the most recent change on the master branch i would like to merge with the other branch.
	  After this, I continued to commit the new changes on the master branch of Working and then pushed them to gitlab. Once this has been
	  completed on the master branch, all merging conflicts had been resolved. 

Three changes made in part C1.)
         - In part C, I simply created three newly separated html files within the working branch.
